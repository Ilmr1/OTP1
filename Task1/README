 Array Equality Tests

 Questions and Answers

 a. What does the `assertArrayEquals` method do?
The `assertArrayEquals` method checks if two arrays are equal. It compares the elements of the arrays in order and ensures that they are identical in both value and order.

 b. What will happen if the arrays `a1` and `a2` are not equal in `testSingleDimensionalArrayEquality`?
If the arrays `a1` and `a2` are not equal, the test will fail, and an assertion error will be thrown, indicating that the arrays are not equal.

 c. How does the `assertArrayEquals` method handle multi-dimensional arrays as seen in `testMultiDimensionalArrayEquality`?
The `assertArrayEquals` method handles multi-dimensional arrays by recursively comparing each sub-array. For the arrays to be equal, all corresponding sub-arrays must also be equal.
